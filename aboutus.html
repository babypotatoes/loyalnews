It was built on encouraging the creativity and imaginations of the youth by building platforms that empower them. The project was slowly built upon by Velnosky until<span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;early 2016 when it was officially founded as Loyal and expanded into a team project amongst five people.</span></p><p>Loyal built its foundation as a primarily music company and launched the first project under it on December 17th of 2016 called The Loyal Collective. It is the driving force of Loyal and most other projects either relate back to or are built on The Loyal Collective. Honoring the original mission of Polar, The Loyal Collective started as a broad family for creatives to join and collaborate within. It gave artists, musicians, writers, and more access to resources they wouldn't have otherwise. Over the course of the next three years, The Loyal Collective would be refined to a music record label and many of its other members would be moved to projects better tailored to them.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">PO/LAR and Symmetry were created in this refinement process as new homes for the many members who did not fit in the new Loyal Collective.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Loyal is dedicated to restoring creativity and imagination in Earth's future inheritants. We believe that creativity should be nutured and expanded on and that takes adventure, exploration, and new experiences. Too many doors have been shut and Loyal believes in opening them again.</span></p></div>
